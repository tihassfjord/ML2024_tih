    "Welcome to my report on Assignment 1 for the Machine Learning course (Fys-2021)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques of machine learning. Machine learning is a fascinating field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this report, we will cover various topics related to machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and introduction to deep learning. We will delve into the concepts, algorithms, and techniques used in each of these areas, providing a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this report are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To provide a clear and concise overview of the key concepts and techniques in machine learning.\n",
    "2. To demonstrate an understanding of the practical application of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "3. To showcase the ability to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.\n",
    "4. To explore the potential of deep learning and its applications in various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this report, you will have gained valuable insights into the field of machine learning and developed practical skills in applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the exciting world of machine learning and explore the possibilities it offers for building intelligent systems!\n",
